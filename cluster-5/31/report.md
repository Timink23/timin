## Summary
In the video youc an see that the lidar and garmin are plugged in, and when i place my hand in front of the sensor the wheels stop spinning. I had it set to a small delay so that it is very reactionary and made the distance large, so that it stopped as far away from a 'hazard' as possible. the fact that the wheels are spinning continiuosly until you put your hand in front shows that the lidar is operating continuously.
