## Summary
The two fobs are talking to each other. but for this skill, only one needed to receive signals from the other. upon button press, i print what state it should change to, 1,2 or 3 and depending on these ID numbers, the light changes. the video cleary shows that when i switch to 3, the receiving fob also switches to 3, thus demonstrating that there is clear transmission between the 2 fobs
