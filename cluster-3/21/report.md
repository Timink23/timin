## Summary
We read about 3-4 totorials and combined the commands that we found to install what was required to the raspberry pi and transmit the camera footage directly to a serperate computer, as seen in the video. 
192.161.1.122:8081 was the IP that we used to register the camera.
Had to make sure the raspberry pi was connected to the router and navigated through multiple errors from the terminal. 

All in all, succeeded and evidence is shown below
