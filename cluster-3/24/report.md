## Summary
You can enter numbers from 1 to 9, 9 being the brightest level the LED can go to. if you type 'cycle' it will loop through 1 to 9 and back to 0, as seen in the video. Used a simple case/break statement to set the levels and made sure there was a 25ms gap between them. increments were 500 because 5000/10 is 500.
